# TodoMVC Playwright Exercise

This repository contains an automated test script for **UI testing** of the TodoMVC application using **Playwright**.

## üìù Challenge Overview

The goal of this exercise is to perform the following steps on the [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com/examples/react/dist/) application:

1. Navigate to the TodoMVC page and confirm that the URL is correct.
2. Add a TODO item with the text:
   - `"TODO 1 - "` concatenated with the current date.
3. Verify that the TODO item appears in the list.
4. Add another TODO item with the text:
   - `"TODO 2 - "` concatenated with tomorrow's date.
5. Mark the current date TODO item (`TODO 1`) as **completed**.
6. Verify that the completed item is displayed as **struck-through**.
7. Delete the `TODO 2` item (tomorrow's date).
8. Verify that the deleted item is removed from the list.
9. Generate a **test report** summarizing the test results using **Allure**.
